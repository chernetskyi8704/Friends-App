# Friends App

## Project Overview

The task of the project was to create a small social media friend search page with user cards, search, sort, and filter by age, surname, and first name using the Random User API.

## Summary

This project gave me good practice in which I interacted with a third-party API to get the data I had to work with later. This helped me to better understand how JS works under the hood, namely, the difference between synchronous and asynchronous code, where it is executed, and in what sequence. Also, in this project, I practiced writing modular code using ES6 modules and using various array methods, such as map, sort, and filter.
